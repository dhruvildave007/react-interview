Create a small React app that allows users to submit feedback and view a summary.

Requirements:
There are 3 buttons: “Good”, “Neutral”, and “Bad”.

When a button is clicked, the count for that feedback type should increase.

Below the buttons, show a statistics panel that displays:

Total feedback count

Percentage of “Good” feedback

A message like "No feedback yet" if no button is clicked


after reload the panel should contain the data
Add a "Reset" button to clear all feedback.

Style it with basic CSS or inline styles.
